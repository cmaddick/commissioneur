## Server

The PHP code for providing interaction between the front-end website and the back-end SQL database.

## Website

The HTML, CSS and JavaScript source files (along with associated site-only images that aren't uploaded by the user) needed to display the commissioneur website. This will interact with the server's PHP code to provide access to the back-end MySQL database.
